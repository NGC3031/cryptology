# cryptology
Not "crypto". Cryptology in various languages. Just a dump as I work through some books. No claim that anything is specifically mine here or anything new. 

NB: As a general - *** dont use a toaster in the bath warning *** - dont use anything here or probably anywhere else for anything serious.
